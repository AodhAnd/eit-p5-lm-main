2.4 m/s is the max velocity(steady state)
point to read the time constant:

(topSpeed - firstStepSpeed)*.632              
(   2.9   -       1.1     )*.632  = 1.1376 - now we a percented of the topspeed (see graph where)
=>
Adding the offset of the first step to find the point to read the time constant:
1.1376 + 1.1 = 2.2376 [m/s] - To find it in the data, we need to move it up again?
- before the percented of the topspeed was found by making a new zero, but we need to look at the data to get the
- the actual time constant.

The value in time here is:
5312 [ms]

the value in time where the rising edge starts is:
5054 [ms]

So the time constant is: 5312 - 5054 = 258 [ms]
tau = 0.258 [s]

Using this formula to calculate J:
J = tau*(Ra*B+Kt*Ke)*(Ra^-1)


Where did we find it? Good question!:D
Thomas found it in an other student report containing a tracked vehicle.
Where do you find this student repport you ask?
Good question! Don't know!:)
