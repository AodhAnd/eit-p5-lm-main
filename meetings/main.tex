\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Step for the vehicle with PI controller on the plant, looks like a 2nd order so offset, but it's okay
\item[-] Test are fine
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steering}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] sensors: Magnetometer and GoT 
\item[-] magnetometr: P controller and PI controller overshoot so P controller with lead, working like a PD controller
magnetometer doesn't work inthe GoT room
split in two the test for the report, and maybe if we have time before the exam we will install outside the GoT system
inner loop test: what was the purpose?
\end{itemize}
